            <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: initial;">On the other hand, there’s the idea that “creativity is knowing how to hide your sources” — a quote often attributed to Albert Einstein, though more likely coined by humorist C.E.M. Joad. (Appropriate, no?) . Either way, it’s not hard to know what’s trendy. Just lift your eyes off your smartphone and take a look around — or don’t!

            What matters is understanding the hows and whys of trends’ emergence and adoption. Because at the end of the day, trends have a lot to tell us about our cultural moment: what we love, what we hate, what we want to move toward. The closer we get to understanding those things, the closer we get to getting inside others’ heads — to empathizing with them. And, really, to understanding ourselves.

            After all, when the art historians, fashion critics, and web designers of the future look back on our current era, what they’ll see and comment on will be the foremost trends of our day. When they discuss the aesthetics of the 20teens, they’ll really be discussing what was trendy — and what bucked the trends.

            Trends, then, are history in the making.

            With all that in mind, let’s see what future historians will be saying about today. With a little help from a few modern tastemakers.

            Our first contributor is Zack Onisko, CEO at @dribbble, cool dad, guitar noodler.</p>
           <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: initial;">
            Just when you thought the future was flat, brands like Pitch and Stripe are throwing their brand weight behind a new-old-fashioned form of illustration: 3D.

            Not content with the cut-out illustration style popularized by Slack, designers are looking to add depth and realism to graphics designed to blur the boundaries between the digital and physical worlds.

            In a sense, this sharpens the contrast between digital products and human beings, even as it brings them together into imaginary spaces where people can grasp and manipulate digital elements (like the graphs and icons in Pitch’s hero section). You can’t help but think of the popular assertion that Facebook’s real disruption is the way it makes us, its users, into the product — and wonder if designers aren’t subconsciously pushing against this notion.

            Of course, if that’s the case, this feels like a merely incremental evolution. These designs don’t so much grant people their humanity back as render them from flat illustrations into cartoons.

            With that in mind, perhaps Stripe’s much more realistic credit card animation offers a glimpse of a future where the physical and digital can be rendered as such. 
           </p>
           <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: initial;">
            But that realization has many of us “users” wondering: is the price of admission worth the return on investment? Has the transformation from mobile “phone” to pocket-sized supercomputer cost us more than it’s brought us?

            And if that’s the case: how can we correct the imbalance? Can we have our cake and eat it too?

            But you, reading this, can’t just answer these questions as a “user.” You’re also, probably, a maker too. So in 2019, it’s time (it’s past time) to ask yourself:

            What can I do to put people back in control of their engagement, their usage, their lives?
